# falsePosition Algorithm

This function finds an estimate for the root of a function using the false position root finding method.

The inputs for this function are: the function being evaluated, the lower guess value, the upper guess value, the stopping criterion in percent, and the maximum amount of iterations to be performed.

The outputs for this function are the: root estimate, f(x) value pertaining to the root estimate, approximate relative error, number of iterations completed before ending.

This function has issues and does not perform correctly yet.
