# luFactor Algorithm

This function determines the LU Factorization for a square matrix.

The input is a matrix consisting of the coefficients in the system of equations.

The outputs are three matrices: a lower triangular matrix, a upper triangular matrix, and a pivot matrix.

The upper triangular and pivot matrices perform correctly however the lower diagonal matrix has an issue where the coefficient ends up in the wrong position of the matrix.
